**Day1 of 66DaysOfData :books:**
- **Python:** On my first day of #66DaysofData I revised the basics of python for a fresh start even though I had experience on python. Today I read about various datatypes in python such as booleans, lists, strings, tuples. I also learned about loops and list comprehensions and completed all the exercises on these topics. The Python tutorial along with exercises on kaggle helped me to broaden my knowledge. I hope you will also spend some time learning the topics below. Excited on my journey ahead!!
- **Topics:**
  - Python syntax, variable assignment and numbers
  - Functions
  - Booleans and Conditionals
  - Lists

**Day2 of 66DaysOfData :books:**
- **Python:** On my second day of #66DaysofData I learned about strings and dictionaries and their various methods. I also learned about how to work with external libraries in Python. I also did a fun exercise which introduced me to machine learning at the end of the session. I classified the data of people in the Titanic and identified those who had highest chance of survival through random forest model. I hope you will also spend some time learning the topics below. Excited on my journey ahead!!
- **Topics:**
  - strings and dictionaries
