**Day1 of 66DaysOfData :books:**
- **Python:** On my first day of #66DaysofData I revised the basics of python for a fresh start even though I had experience on python. Today I read about various datatypes in python such as booleans, lists, strings, dictionaries, tuples. I also gained more insight on working with external libraries. The Python tutorial along with exercises on kaggle helped me to broaden my knowledge. I hope you will also spend some time learning the topics below. Excited on my journey ahead!!
- **Topics:**
  - Python syntax, variable assignment and numbers
  - Functions
  - Booleans and Conditionals
  - Lists
  - Loops and List Comprehensions
  - Strings and Dictionaries
  - Working with External Libraries
