**Day1 of 66DaysOfData :books:**
- **Python:** On my first day of #66DaysofData I revised the basics of python for a fresh start even though I had experience on python. Today I read about various datatypes in python such as booleans, lists, strings, tuples. I also learned about loops and list comprehensions and completed all the exercises on these topics. The Python tutorial along with exercises on kaggle helped me to broaden my knowledge. I hope you will also spend some time learning the topics below. Excited on my journey ahead!!
- **Topics:**
  - Python syntax, variable assignment and numbers
  - Functions
  - Booleans and Conditionals
  - Lists
  - Loops and List Comprehensions
